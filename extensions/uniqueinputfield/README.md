# Field: Unique Text Input

- Version: 1.5
- Author: Symphony Team (team@symphony-cms.com)
- Build Date: 29th May 2012
- Requirements: Symphony 2.3+


## Installation

1. Upload the `/uniqueinputfield` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Unique Text Input", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Unique Text Input" field to your sections.


## Usage

- Behaves identically to a normal text input, however it enforces uniqueness and you cannot group the output in Data Sources.

- Two modes allow you to choose between throwing an error, "This must be unique", or attempting to make the handle unique automatically by appending an number, eg. `my-entry-handle-2`
